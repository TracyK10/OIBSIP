# My Oasis Infobyte Internship Projects

Welcome to my Oasis Infobyte Internship journey! Below, I'll walk you through the projects I've completed at different levels of web development proficiency. Each project has been a valuable learning experience for me.

## Level 1 Projects

### Landing Page
For my first task, I created a captivating landing page for a fictional product. It was an exciting challenge to design a visually appealing layout that would catch the user's attention right away.
